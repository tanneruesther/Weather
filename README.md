## Why I Created This Project
I created this project as part of my learning journey to improve my skills in web development, specifically working with APIs.
My goal was to learn how to fetch real-time data from a third-party API and display it dynamically on a webpage.
By building this project, I wanted to:
            - Understand how to make API requests and handle responses.
            - Learn how to interact with external services using JavaScript.
            - Improve my web development skills by applying my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            - Explore how to build interactive and user-friendly applications.

This project helped me practice working with JavaScript for dynamic content, as well as the concepts of asynchronous programming (using `fetch` and `async/await`), which are crucial in modern web development.
